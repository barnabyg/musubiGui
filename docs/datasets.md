# Dataset acceptance

After `npm.cmd run build`, run `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m musubi_gui.dataset_fixture .cache\dataset-demo --launch`.
Use a new destination each time; existing fixture directories are preserved. Open the printed loopback URL
(default `http://127.0.0.1:8767`) and register the printed mixed-media folder in Datasets.
The CC0 fixture contains two images, one video and one deliberately invalid video. No GPU, model weights,
training Python or downloads are required. Media decoding and thumbnails use the application's pinned PyAV/Pillow.

Check the four indexed items, missing-caption coverage, image/video preview and named invalid-media error.
Re-scan unchanged files, restart with `MUSUBI_GUI_STATE` pointing at the fixture's `state` folder, and confirm
the library survives. Source files stay in place. Paths outside Settings' dataset roots are rejected after
symlink/junction resolution. If the source folder disappears, its library entry is retained for recovery.

The gallery renders a bounded window of tiles. Browser codec support depends on Edge; containers accepted
by PyAV may need re-encoding for playback. The original file is preserved when Edge cannot play it.
